# Data

Datasets, ontologies, configs, and experiment outputs used by SAED-LLM.

## Layout
- `ontologies/`: ontology files.
- `tables/`: input tables.
- `runs/`: run outputs.
- `batches/`: batch configs.

## Quick start
- Put ontologies in `ontologies/` and tables in `tables/`.
- Reference them from `data/config.json` or the CLI tools.
